Core Idea:

A simple, joyful K–3 learning app with:
	•	Two subjects:
Early Math + Early History
	•	Two worlds:
Math World + History World
	•	A tiny map: 20 total levels
(10 math + 10 history)
	•	Princess Amara as the main character
	•	1–3 friendly side characters
	•	Super minimalist animation (Pocoyo-inspired)
	•	Lightweight adaptive AI that tracks learning patterns (not predictions)

🔸 the culture-forward historical figures:
	•	King Sejong
	•	Tariq ibn Ziyad
	•	Abd al-Rahman I
	•	Averroes (Ibn Rushd)
	•	Ella Cara Deloria
	•	Mary Golda Ross
	•	Amelia Earhart
	•	Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson, Dorothy Vaughan
	•	William Kamkwamba
	•	Mary Beatrice Davidson Kenner

This is the exact list integrated into the History World gameplay.

🧩 2. App Structure

A. Home Screen
	•	White minimalist background
	•	Princess Amara stands center, waving
	•	Two giant buttons:
	1.	Math Adventure
	2.	History Adventure
	•	Underneath:
“World Level 3 / 20”
(simple progress bar)

B. World Map
	•	A straight horizontal path of circles
	•	Circles = levels
	•	When a level is complete, circle fills with color
	•	Kids tap to go to the next mini-game

C. Lessons (Gameplay)

Each lesson is:
	•	A tiny 30–60 sec activity
	•	Simple dragging, sorting, tapping
	•	Occasional meetings with historical figures in short dialogue bubbles

Minimal assets, maximum learning.

📚 3. Content (Complete and Integrated)

Math World (10 Levels)

All extremely easy to implement:
	1.	Counting fruit
	2.	Sorting shapes
	3.	Matching patterns
	4.	Drag-to-complete sequences
	5.	Counting animals
	6.	Pouring water into the right size cup
	7.	Simple fraction (“cut the apple in half”)
	8.	Match numbers to groups
	9.	Sorting objects by size
	10.	Simple puzzle combining multiple skills

⸻

History World (10 Levels)

This is where we integrate ALL your cultural figures simply and beautifully.

Structure:

The History World is divided into three “eras”:
	1.	The Moors (3 levels)
	2.	Indigenous & Diaspora Innovators (4 levels)
	3.	Asian Navigators & Women Pioneers (3 levels)

Each “era” has one main guide character the child meets.

⸻

⭐ Era 1: The Moors (3 Levels)

Characters:
	•	Tariq ibn Ziyad (lead guide)
	•	Abd al-Rahman I (builder)
	•	Averroes (thinker)

Activities:

Level 1 — Meet Tariq
Drag-and-drop puzzle: “Help Tariq place the ships where they belong.”

Level 2 — Build with Abd al-Rahman I
Kids assemble simple shapes to “build” a tiny courtyard.

Level 3 — Think With Averroes
Kids sort pictures into two categories:
	•	“Ideas”
	•	“Tools”

Very simple logic puzzle.

⸻

⭐ Era 2: Native American & African Innovators (4 Levels)

Characters:
	•	Ella Cara Deloria
	•	Mary Golda Ross
	•	William Kamkwamba
	•	Mary Beatrice Davidson Kenner

Activities:

Level 4 — Ella Cara Deloria
Match symbols/words → introduces simplicity of Dakota language patterns.

Level 5 — Mary Golda Ross
Kids move “space pieces” into the right order (just shapes).
She says: “Engineers love patterns!”

Level 6 — William Kamkwamba
Kids drag windmill blades to assemble a small windmill.

Level 7 — Mary Beatrice Davidson Kenner
Kids sort inventors by category:
	•	“Inventions for the home”
	•	“Inventions for outdoors”

⸻

⭐ Era 3: Asian Navigators & Women Innovators (3 Levels)

Characters:
	•	King Sejong (main guide of this era — honors your Korean cultural influence)
	•	Amelia Earhart
	•	Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson, Dorothy Vaughan (appear together in one simple scene)

Activities:

Level 8 — King Sejong
A mini Hangul activity:
Match a Hangul block shape to its sound (like ㄱ → “g”).

Level 9 — Amelia Earhart
Kids “trace” a very simple line for a plane path.

Level 10 — NASA’s Hidden Figures
Kids tap numbers to “send the rocket up.”
Simple counting or sequencing.
The three appear together as supportive characters.

🤖 4. Small AI Feature (Feasible for Limited Resources)

The app silently tracks:
	•	Which puzzles are completed quickly
	•	Which ones are repeated
	•	What type of puzzles the child prefers (visual, logic, sorting, story)

At the end of each week, parents get 1–2 insights:
	•	“Your child enjoys engineering puzzles.”
	•	“Your child learns quickly with pattern games.”

This is just rule-based, stored in local JSON — zero ML cost.

🎨 5. Art & Animation Style

Minimalist:
	•	White backgrounds
	•	Thick outlines
	•	Simple geometric shapes
	•	Pocoyo-style soft colors
	•	Zero shading needed

Princess Amara:
	•	Idle animation (slight sway)
	•	Clap animation
	•	Jump animation

Historical Figures:
	•	Single looping “talking” animation
	•	Static standing pose
	•	Simple soft facial expressions

EASY 2D animation for a junior animator or AI-assisted illustration.
