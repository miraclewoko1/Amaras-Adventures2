Build a browser-based mini-game that teaches logical fallacies to K–3 students using simple language, colorful visuals, and interactive choices.

Inspiration Source:
Use https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/ as the conceptual reference for the types of fallacies, but rewrite all explanations in kid-friendly, layman’s terms suitable for early elementary learners.

Core Features:

1. Fallacy Cards (Kid-Friendly Definitions)
   Create a set of illustrated cards. Each card introduces one fallacy in simple language:
   - "Jumping to Conclusions" (Hasty Generalization)
   - "Everyone Says So!" (Bandwagon)
   - "That’s Not What I Asked!" (Strawman)
   - "You’re Just Being Mean!" (Ad Hominem)
   - "It Happened Before, So It Will Happen Again!" (False Cause)

   Each card should include:
   • A simple definition in kid language  
   • A short example using friendly characters (animals, kids, or creatures)  
   • A big, colorful icon  

2. Interactive Game Modes
   A. “Spot the Mistake!”
      - Show a short scenario with two characters talking.
      - Students choose which fallacy card matches the mistake.
      - Provide positive feedback and a simple explanation.

   B. “Fix the Mistake!”
      - Show a fallacy scenario.
      - Students drag-and-drop a better response to “fix” the thinking.

   C. “Choose the Fair Answer!”
      - Present two answers: one fallacy, one fair reasoning.
      - Students tap the fair one.

3. Accessibility & Simplicity
   - Use large buttons, emojis, and simple sentences.
   - Add optional voice narration for non-readers.
   - Include gentle sound effects and animations.

4. Progress Tracking
   - After each round, save a JSON entry:
     {
       "student_id": "string",
       "activity_id": "logical_fallacies_k3",
       "fallacy_correct": ["jumping_to_conclusions", "bandwagon"],
       "fallacy_incorrect": ["strawman"],
       "timestamp": "ISO string",
       "growth_level": "emerging | developing | proficient | advanced"
     }

5. Teacher/Parent Dashboard
   - Display which fallacies the student understands.
   - Show improvement over time.
   - Allow replay of specific fallacies the student struggles with.

Requirements:
- Use HTML/CSS/JS with modular functions.
- Keep all definitions and examples in kid-friendly language.
- Ensure the game is responsive for tablets.
- Comment code clearly so new fallacies can be added easily.
